This script is designed to work on a Virtual Machine. If you want to run it on a physical machine, you need a wireless adapter with the AR9271 chipset. Additionally, you must replace eth0 with wlan0 in the script to use it against a real machine connected to your network.
Also make sure you have turned on port forwarding.
